### ✨ Abstract:
The Poster Project is a web application with many functions. Its first function is to create a motivational poster that has a random image, title, and quote. These posters can be saved and viewed on a page with other saved posters. The user can click a button to create random posters to their heart’s content. Inspired users can also create their own posters by adding their own image and writing their own title and quote. As a final sparkle of joy, the un-motivational posters section was created to serve as a bit of humor. Users can see 15 premade unmotivational posters. If they do not like them, they can double-click to delete them.

### 🤔 This app solves three problems: 
1. A need for quick inspiration - In our fast paced world, sometimes a quick inspiration is all people have time for.
2. Creative Expression and Personalization - People like to be engaged and creative as well as consuming great content.
3. A need for humor and light-hearted content - This site is a great and quick reprieve from daily responsibilities with a small but good dose of humor.

### 💭 Learning Goals:
- Practice reading, understanding, and using existing code
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Use array prototype iterator methods to reformat data and display it on the DOM
- Use CSS and HTML to match styling and layout of provided comps

### 🏆 Wins + Challenges: 🤺
- win #1 - I really enjoyed learning about micro-animations. There are a lot of options to with micro-aniamtions to improve the user experience and make the site more intuitive.
- win #2 - I was able to complete the expected portions of the project with enough time to challenge myself with some extensions. I found this valuable because each of the extensions required learning new skills.

- challenge #1 - My biggest struggle was to get the saved poster section to work. I struggled to understand how to create HTML elements, assign them values, and append in the right way all from the DOM. My solution to the struggle was many sided. I started by breaking all of the pieces down with pseudo-code. This helped me to know where I was going to write code and what the steps would be. I then had to research methods to create the HTML elements, accessing the data from the array, and appending the elements in the correct way. I also utilized student support mentors as well as peers to bounce ideas off of.
